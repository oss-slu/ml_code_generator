   <p>
      ML Code generator currently works on CSV data. Once you upload your data we can clean it for you and split it
      into training and testing sets. This is a work in progress, and more options will be available in the future.
      At any step, you can see the Python code we generated by using the "Show code" option in the navigation menu.
